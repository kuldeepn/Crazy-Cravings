## What is Emmet?

Emmet is a web development tool and shorthand syntax for quickly writing HTML and CSS code. It was originally developed as a plugin for text editors like Sublime Text, but it has since been integrated into many popular text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs).

Here are some examples of Emmet abbreviations:

html:5 => generates the basic structure of an HTML5 document.
ul>li*5 => generates an unordered list with five list items.
div.container>div.row>div.col-md-6 => creates a basic Bootstrap-like layout structure.
p.my-paragraph => generates a paragraph element with a class "my-paragraph."

## Difference between a Library and Framework?

In summary, libraries are more like collections of functions and tools that you can use in your code to perform specific tasks, while frameworks are more comprehensive and impose a structure and conventions on your application, requiring you to fit your code into their predefined architecture.
