## What is the difference between Named Export, Default export and \* as export?

Whenever we have to export multiple things from same component that time we can use Named Export.
Default Export we can export once in the component this is the recommended way when we have to export single thing.
You can use the export \* as syntax to export all the named exports from a module as an object
import \* as utils from './utils';
